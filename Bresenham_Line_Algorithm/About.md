# About #
This program is an implementation of the Bresenham Line Algorithm, which is used to draw lines from one point to another, in this case, in a 2D plane. Was done as part of the Digital Design Course.
The algorithm was provided in the assignment. I made a flow chart version of it and that can be shown below.

I implemented this algorithm as a Finite State Machine in Verilog.
